# RE2C

- RE2C is a free, open-source meta-analysis software tool for genome-wide association study analysis, designed to perform both basic and advanced meta-analytic methods in an efficient manner. RE2C allows users to test heterogeneous effect size between individual statistics by using an optimization technique, spectral decomposition. Our optimization procedure is fast and robust and takes only a day for 1 000 000 SNPs.

You can update to the newest version of `PLEIO` using git. First, navigate to your pleio/ directory (e.g., cd pleio), then run
```
git pull
```
